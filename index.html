            <p><strong>Welcome to the Stellenbosch University Developer Society</strong></p>

            <p>We want to create a place that is exciting for people interested in computer
            science and electronics, work on projects together, and build relationships that
            will last past university.</p>

            <p>The goals of the developer society are to create a community where members:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>explore technology</li>
                <li>build friendships</li>
                <li>build projects</li>
                <li>build relationships with people in industry.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you have looked for a place to share things the rest of the world doesn't
            find interesting (your OS, your Vim setup, a personal project, esoteric math,
            etc.), or a place to hear from others who are also interested in these things -
            you can be part of making a community for people like you.</p>

            <h2>Events & Activities</h2>
            <p>Events we host include:</p>
            <ul>
