**Welcome to the Stellebbosch University Computer Club**

We want to create a place that is exciting for people interested in computer
science and electronics, work on projects together, and build relationships that
will last past university.

__The heart of it__: If you have looked for a place to share things the rest of
the world doesn't find interesting (your OS, your Vim setup, a personal project,
esoteric math, etc.), or a place to hear from others who are also interested in
these things - you can be part of making a community for people like you.

__Events & Activities__: Events we would like to host include:
* Discussions of projects we have worked on.
* Tackling projects we would like to work on together.
* Hackatons
* Quiz nights
* Talks from professors or people from industry
* Movie nights

Check out our [events](/events/) page to see what's happening when.

__Community goals__: The most important thing is that people should build
relationships in the society that last past university. This can be done
alongside learning and creating projects together. Organising talks from
industry people would also be good for networking.
