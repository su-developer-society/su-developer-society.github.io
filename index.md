**Welcome to the Stellebosch University Developer Society**

We want to create a place that is exciting for people interested in computer
science and electronics, work on projects together, and build relationships that
will last past university.

__The heart of it__: If you have looked for a place to share things the rest of
the world doesn't find interesting (your OS, your Vim setup, a personal project,
esoteric math, etc.), or a place to hear from others who are also interested in
these things - you can be part of making a community for people like you.

__Events & Activities__: Events we would like to host include:
* Discussions of projects we have worked on.
* Tackling projects we would like to work on together.
* Hackathons
* Quiz nights
* Talks from professors or people from industry
* Movie nights

Check out our [events](/events/) page to see what's happening when.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact Willie Loftie-Eaton :)
