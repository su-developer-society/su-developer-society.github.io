## Introductory message
```
Hello,

I am organising events for a society at Stellenbosch University called the
Developer Society - a society for students interested in computers and software
engineering.

Events I am trying to organise include talks from industry, hackathons, and
general social events. I'm reaching out to you to ask if your company would be
interested in one of the following:
 1. Host a talk on or near campus to share work your company has done, and meet with our students.
 2. Invite the developer society for a tour to your company.
 3. Become a sponsor for a hackathon I am organising - any contribution will be appreciated.

If any of these sound interesting to you, or if you'd like to know more about
the SU Developer Society, please let me know!

Regards
```
